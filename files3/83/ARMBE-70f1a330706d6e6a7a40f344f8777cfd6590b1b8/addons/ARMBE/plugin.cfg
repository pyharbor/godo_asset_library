name="Android RMB Emulator"
description=" What this plugin does in its core: ALT+LMB = RMB, that's it. Why?

Godot engine released for android devices but its not very usable - android does not properly pick up RMB clicks from external mice, sometimes treating them like 'back' button presses, sometimes not doing anything at all. May not work properly until you restart the engine :'D

Made solely for my purposes of attempting something on my phone whilst I dont have a proper laptop yet to work during train rides."
